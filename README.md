# DSP-Histogram-Equalization-Implementation
Digital Signal Processing, Histogram Equalization Implementation 

In this project, two different (normal and modified histogram equalization) histogram equalization algorithm are implemented. 
These algortihms are tested on test2.jpg and the results compared with Opencv(cv.equalizeHist) histogram equalization algorithm. 
Modified histogram equalization method gives more similar(same) results as opencv.
